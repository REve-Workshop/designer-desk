   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2019-11-19 mar. 08:17]
   Some applications need to be installed in the user environement and not during host setup.

   It should be easier to manage everything from one ansible project
   instead of 2 or more for those tasks.

   In the new project, create 4 playbooks:
   - =host-setup.yml=, setup a new host or ensure that a host has the minimum required for a REVE host.
   - =user-setup.yml=, setup a new user or ensure that a user is setup according to my standard.
   - =deploy-config.yml=, ensure the configuration is deployed for a user 
   - =sites.yml=, call the 3 other playbooks in this order:
     1. =host-setup.yml=
     2. =user-setup.yml=
     3. =deploy-config.yml=

   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2019-11-21 jeu. 08:20]
   The document should:
   - describe the variables used and how and where to populate them.
     - Idea: use =group_vars=, see actual implementation
       ([2019-11-05 mar.]) of =deploy-config= and =setup-host=.
   - define the intent of the playbooks.

** TODO Study how to use the skeleton parameter of the =user= module

   :ID:       cb42b36f-7101-4987-a575-134fe083c296

   The skeleton parameter allows to use the skeleton feature of linux
   system. When using this feature, the content of =/etc/skel=, the
   skeleton directory, is used to populate the user's $HOME directory
   with an initial content.

   The skeleton directory should be populated during the host setup
   phase.

   The UHK repository provide a file called =latest.yml=. Check with
   the vendor if it can be reliably used to retrieve the latest
   version of the agent and firmware.
