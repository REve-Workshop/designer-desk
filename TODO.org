   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2019-11-19 mar. 08:17]
   Some applications need to be installed in the user environement and not during host setup.

   It should be easier to manage everything from one ansible project
   instead of 2 or more for those tasks.

   In the new project, create 4 playbooks:
   - =host-setup.yml=, setup a new host or ensure that a host has the minimum required for a REVE host.
   - =user-setup.yml=, setup a new user or ensure that a user is setup according to my standard.
   - =deploy-config.yml=, ensure the configuration is deployed for a user 
   - =sites.yml=, call the 3 other playbooks in this order:
     1. =host-setup.yml=
     2. =user-setup.yml=
     3. =deploy-config.yml=

   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2019-11-21 jeu. 08:20]
   The document should:
   - describe the variables used and how and where to populate them.
     - Idea: use =group_vars=, see actual implementation
       ([2019-11-05 mar.]) of =deploy-config= and =setup-host=.
   - define the intent of the playbooks.

   The skeleton parameter allows to use the skeleton feature of linux
   system. When using this feature, the content of =/etc/skel=, the
   skeleton directory, is used to populate the user's $HOME directory
   with an initial content.

   The skeleton directory should be populated during the host setup
   phase.

   The UHK repository provides a file called =latest.yml=. Check with
   the vendor if it can be reliably used to retrieve the latest
   version of the agent and firmware.

   - File name: =cabs.lisp=
   - Location: =#P"cl/tools/"=

   It must collect all directories that contain an =asd= file, for a
   given directory tree. It must do it recursively.

   Next, those collected path must be added to the ASDF registry
   global variable =asdf:*central-registry*=.
** TODO Add a directory for the management of DBMS

   :ID:       4a90c91a-c646-4526-a3c5-b9cc6c1eb469
   :END:
   This directory should contain one file per database management
   system. The priority must be toward plain text lisp format.

   Foreseen format:
   - fact-base
   - sexp - =com.informatimago.common-lisp.cesarum=

   Location: =#P"cl/is/"=
   Directory name: =#P"dbms/"=

   These source files are responsible for providing a common API to
   access data stored in files of the given format. This includes
   opening and closing the file, and ensuring that any buffered data
   is written when closing the file.

   Foreseen API:
   - =open=, connect the calling application to the database
   - =close=, close the connection
   - crud API:
     - =insert= / =create=, add a record to the database
     - =read=, read a record from the data base
     - =update=, update a record in the database
     - =delete=, remove a record from the database
   - =load=, load the database in memory for use by the crud API
   - =save=, save all the changes to the database
** TODO Add a file to provide a query API for the information system

   File name: =query.lisp=
   Location: =#P"cl/is/"=

   Foreseen functions and macros:
   - =search=: will allow to search for entries in a information
               system for data corresponding to given criteria.
     - Parameters:
       - =is=: information system.
       - =path=: the search will be limited to elements present at that path.
       - =condition=: the condition to match to collect a value.
       - =fields=: a list of fields whose data must be returned.
     - Possible Returned values:
       - A list of records, if the query is successful.
       - =nil=, if the query returns nothing.
       - a complex lisp object, in case of error, with all the data to
         help diagnose the problem.

   Foreseen criteria:
   - =one-of=: The field must contains one of the element in the
               provided list or vector.
   - =unique=: The value must be present only once in the scope.
   - =and=
   - =or=

   :END:
   File name: =boot.lisp=
   Location: =#P"cl/is/"=

   The file must provides ways to initialize a new file system, but
   also to boot an existing one. And to ensure that the calling
   program can manage the data consistently.

   Foreseen function:
   - =init-information-system=: creates an new information system.
     - =is-name=: name of the information system.
     - =description=: a text describing the information system.
     - =ism-location=: an empty directory where the information system manager
       this information system will reside.
